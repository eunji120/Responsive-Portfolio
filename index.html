        <p>Along with her father and sister, Eunji first came to Canada to study as an international student in November, 2006. The first town she lived in was a medium-sized, farm town named Medicine Hat in Alberta. The town is known for the world's largest teepee along with its natural blend with prairie. Being in Alberta, Medicine Hat was a very cold place for a newly arrived Asian family, but its people were nice and friendly. Eunji went to a Catholic junior high school, although her family was not religious at all and still isn't.
    </p> 
    
        <p>After junior high, Eunji moved to Calgary to attend Western Canada High School, where she completed International Baccalaureate Diploma. The city was definitely bigger than Medicine Hat, because Eunji learned not to say 'Hi' to any people walking by. High school life was...ok, I guess.
    </p>
    
        <p>After getting accepted to several univiersities, she decided to attend University of Toronto, mostly because she wanted to live as far away as possible from Alberta and family and enjoy freedom that a typical high schooler would want. After the first year of Life Science program, she spontaneously decided to persue double majors in Neuroscience and Theatre program. Being typical Asian mom and dad, her parents were not in love with the idea. Nevertheless, she went ahead, because her moto is..."If I'm going to regret anyway, I'd rather regret for doing it than to regret for not doing it." After graduating with Honours Bachelor of Science (Eunji had to choose between science or arts), she hasn't regretted her life decision of taking a Theatre program. To this day, she is working full-time and living her life.
